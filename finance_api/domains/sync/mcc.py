"""Monobank MCC → canonical category mapping.

ISO 18245 Merchant Category Codes mapped to the canonical categories defined in
finance_api.domains.transactions.categories. Add new codes here when a transaction
shows up as uncategorized — never add category logic to monobank.py directly.

Coverage: ~300 MCCs covering the most common spending patterns.
